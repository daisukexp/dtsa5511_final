### Introduction
For the culminating project in my Deep Learning course, it was imperative to select a subject that resonated with personal interests. Given the pervasive influence of music in my life, I turned my attention to areas within this realm. My decision was to leverage a dataset that facilitates the generation of lyrics across distinct musical genres, such as Rock, Pop, Heavy Metal, and Hip Hop.

### About Dataset

The dataset, titled "Song Lyrics from 79 Musical Genres", was sourced from Kaggle. While the primary application of this dataset pertains to the prediction of musical genres based on lyrics, for the scope of this project, it serves as a reservoir of lyrics classified by genre or artist.

The dataset can be accessed at the following link:

There are two main files in this dataset: artists-data.csv and lyrics-data.csv.

### Problem Definition
In the vast landscape of music, each genre carries its distinct linguistic nuances, characterized by specific words and phrases that resonate with its essence. Our primary objective in this study is to develop a system that, when provided with a specified genre, can generate lyrics that seamlessly align with the linguistic intricacies unique to that genre. By harnessing the power of deep learning and drawing insights from our chosen dataset, we aspire to generte lyrics of the designated genre.

### Approach & Methodology
Our methodology distinguishes itself from typical solutions found on platforms like Kaggle, which often focus primarily on visualizing dataset trends. Our approach is more holistic, encompassing the following elements:

- Build Multiple Models:
We plan to develop and test several RNN models. Our aim is to evaluate their performance in generating lyrics. By comparing the results, we can determine the most effective model for our purposes.

- Analysis:
Our analysis is multifaceted. In this project, we emphasize computational efficiency during model construction, in addition to prioritizing model accuracy. This dual focus ensures our model is not only precise but also performance-optimized. By adopting this approach, we aim to provide an effective solution to the challenge at hand.
